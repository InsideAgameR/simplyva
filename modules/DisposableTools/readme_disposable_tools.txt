Module provides some widgets and tools for your v7 installation. 

***** Manual Installation Steps

Upload contents of the module (or pull via GitHub) to your root/modules/DisposableTools folder.

Go to admin section and enable the module, that's all.
After enabling/disabling modules an app cache cleaning process IS necessary (check admin/maintenance).

Note for old version users:

Please remove the old files from app\Widgets and resources\views\layouts\your_theme\widgets folders after switching your blades to new version.
No need to have the old files installed under phpvms folders
There will be no updates for old versions and future updates to my theme will NOT use old version widgets.

location *must* be an airport_id (4 letter ICAO code)

***** Options : AirportInfo

No options needed, lists your airports and provides a button to visit that Airport's page

(This widget is developed by Maco and being used in this module by his permission.)

***** Options: FlightTimeMultiplier

No options for this, it is just a javascript calculator. Enter hours, minutes and the multiplier to get the result.Some VA's or platforms offer double or multiplied hours for some tours and events, thus this may come in handy.

Widget may be placed anywhere you wish, best possible location is your pirep fields.blade, just below or above submit/edit buttons.

***** Options : PersonalStats

For PersonalStats there are four main options which are user, disp, type and period;

user can be any user's id or not used at all
period can be any number of days (except 0 of course), currentm, lastm, prevm, currenty, lasty or not used at all
disp can be full or not used at all
type can be avglanding, avgscore, avgtime, tottime, avgdistance, totdistance, avgfuel, totfuel, totflight

If no user is defined, widget get current user's data for calculations. This may be used for dashboard or any personal pages where the viewer will be able to see his results. If you want to put some stats on the user's profile page then you need to define the user otherwise every visitor will see their stats :)
*(['user' => $user->id] is enough to get proper results at user profile page)*

If no period is defined then all accepted reports will be used for calculations, else you will get the result for the last *n* days you provided like Average Landing Rate for flights done in last 15 days
*(['period' => 7] will give you the last 7 days)*

If you want to have a full card with the result and the info text then use *'disp' => full*, while calling the widget. It should be compatible with the default template and stisla but if you need you can customize the look in the *personalstats.blade* file.
Also if you are not using English then you can define the text in your own language in the same file.

['disp' => 'full', 'user' => $user->id, 'type' => 'totfuel', 'period' => 'lastm'] : Total Fuel Spent During Last Month
['disp' => 'full', 'user' => $user->id, 'type' => 'avglanding'] : Average Landing Rate displayed in a card
['user' => $user->id, 'type' => 'totdistance', 'period' => 7] : Plain text total distance in last 7 days
['user' => $user->id, 'type' => 'totflight', 'period' => 3] : Plain text number of flights in last 3 days 

By default widget will provide average landing rate without any html styling considering the viewer's pireps.

location *must* be an airport_id (4 letter ICAO code)

['location' => 'LTAI'] or
['location' => $airport->id] if you are going to use it in Airports page
['location' => $flight->dpt_airport_id] if you are going to use it in Bids or Flight Details page

***** Options : FlightsMap

Shows a Leaflet map from flights or user pireps, Leatlet map itself can be configured/styled via widget blade file if needed.
Has 3 main options, these are *source* , *visible* and *limit* . Visible and limit should be used in custom cases, provided defaults for them are ok for generic usage.

if used source *can* be an airport_id (4 letter ICAO code), an airline_id or user (not user_id, plain text *user*) or can be skipped at all.
if used visible *must* be either false or true (it show visible flights or hides them - default is true like phpvms and only visible flights are used)
if used limit *must* be a numeric value like 50, which will limit the flights being drawn on the map. Default is *null* so all flights are drawn.

['source' => 'LTAI'] or\
['source' => $airport->id] if you are going to use it in Airports page
['source' => $hub->id] if you are going to use it in Disposable Hubs Module: Hub Page
['source' => $airline->id] if you are going to use it in Disposable Airlines Module: Airline Page
['source' => $airline->id, 'limit' => 200] if you are going to use it at Disposable Airlines Module: Airline Page with a limit of max 200 flight.
['source' => 'user', 'limit' => 100] if you are going to use it at User Profile page with a limit of last 100 pireps.

To use the widget at phpvms Flights page, there is no need to define a source. Just load/call the widget directly.
It will follow your admin side settings to filter results (like pilots only see their airline's flights or flight's from their current location)
